- Basic game world - Tile based/

- Player
    - Can walk around/
    - Collision detecting/
    - Can shoot/


Shooting:

    - Delay between shots/
        - Configurable (Powerups)
    - Ammo/
    - Different types of ammo
    - Bullets need a lifespan/
    - reloading instead of ammo?
        - Infinite ammo, but have to reload every 30 shots?
        - Powerups can reduce this reload time or increase shots between reloads
        - Stops spraying and praying




    Bullet system:

    - Base bullet class, abstract/
    - onSpawn, onHit, onDestroy methods/
    - movespeed, damage/
    - Allows bullets to have different animations and stuff when they hit


    Obstacles around the map, making it harder to get around


Waves need adding
    - Wave lasts until you kill all the enemies that spawned at the start/
    - gets harder as the game goes on/
    - Later rounds spawn harder enemies

Bugs:

    -Item hitboxes seem to be a little off
